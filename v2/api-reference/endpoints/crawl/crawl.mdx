title: "Crawl"
api: "POST https://api.getcatalog.ai/v2/crawl"
description: "Async discovery of collections and product listings for a vendor. Returns immediately with an execution_id to check status."
---

<Tip>
**When to use:** Discover and index all product listings from a vendor website. The crawl process will:
1. Discover collections from the vendor
2. Extract product listings from each collection

This is ideal for initial discovery of a new vendor. Use [`POST /v2/extract`](/v2/api-reference/endpoints/extract/extract) to get full product details from discovered listings.
</Tip>

<Note>
**Async Processing:** This endpoint starts processing asynchronously and returns an `execution_id` immediately. Use [`GET /v2/crawl/{execution_id}`](/v2/api-reference/endpoints/crawl/get-crawl-status) to check progress and retrieve results when processing completes.

**Billing Requirement:** Crawl requests require auto top-up to be enabled in your billing settings. This ensures you have sufficient credits to complete the crawl operation.


**View All Executions:** You can view all your crawl executions using [`GET /v2/crawl`](/v2/api-reference/endpoints/crawl/list-crawl-executions) to see all crawl jobs, their statuses, and when they were created.

**Cancel Execution:** You can cancel a running crawl execution using [`DELETE /v2/crawl/{execution_id}`](/v2/api-reference/endpoints/crawl/cancel-crawl-execution) if you need to stop a crawl that is currently processing.
</Note>

## Request

<ParamField header="x-api-key" type="string" required>
  Your API key for authentication
</ParamField>

### Request Body

<ParamField body="url" type="string" required>
  The vendor website URL or domain to crawl

  
  **Note:** The URL will be normalized to a canonical form. If a crawl is already running for the same hostname, the existing execution ID will be returned.
  
  **URL sanitization:** URLs are sanitized and normalized on the backend; client-side sanitization is not required.
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField name="execution_id" type="string">
  Unique execution identifier for this crawl job. Use this ID with [`GET /v2/crawl/{execution_id}`](/v2/api-reference/endpoints/crawl/get-crawl-status) to check progress.
  
  **Format:** `crawl-{hostname}-{uuid}`
  
  **Note:** If a crawl is already running for the same hostname, this will return the existing execution ID.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="status" type="string">
  Initial execution status. Always `"pending"` when the crawl is first started.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="meta" type="object">
  Metadata about the request
  
  <Expandable title="Meta Object">
    <ResponseField name="credits_used" type="number">
      Number of credits charged for starting this crawl operation
    </ResponseField>
    
    <ResponseField name="request_id" type="string" optional>
      Unique request identifier for support purposes (also available in the `Request-ID` response header)
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<Note>
**HTTP Status Code:** This endpoint returns `202 Accepted` to indicate the request has been accepted for processing. The response body contains the execution details you need to track the crawl progress.
