title: "Get Crawl Status"
api: "GET https://api.getcatalog.ai/v2/crawl/{execution_id}"
description: "Get crawl status and results for an asynchronous crawl job."
openapi: "openapi/v2-crawl.yaml GET /crawl/{execution_id}"
---

<Tip>
**When to use:** After starting a crawl job with the POST endpoint, use this endpoint to:
- Check if the crawl is complete
- Monitor real-time progress with step-by-step status
- Get detailed metrics including collections and listings found
- Track execution timing and duration
</Tip>

<Note>
**Cancel Running Executions:** If you need to stop a crawl that is currently running, use [`DELETE /v2/crawl/{execution_id}`](/v2/api-reference/endpoints/crawl/cancel-crawl-execution) to stop the execution.
</Note>

## Polling Strategy

For best results when waiting for completion:

1. **Initial Poll:** Check status immediately after receiving `execution_id`
2. **Polling Interval:** Wait 10-30 seconds between polls for running executions (crawls can take longer than product processing)
3. **Exponential Backoff:** Consider increasing wait time for long-running crawls
4. **Timeout:** Set a maximum wait time based on the size of the vendor website
5. **Step Monitoring:** Use the `steps` array in the response to see which phase of the crawl is currently executing
6. **Progress Tracking:** Monitor `meta.progress` to see real-time counts of collections and listings discovered
7. **Cancellation:** If a crawl is taking too long or you need to stop it, use [`DELETE /v2/crawl/{execution_id}`](/v2/api-reference/endpoints/crawl/cancel-crawl-execution) to stop running executions
