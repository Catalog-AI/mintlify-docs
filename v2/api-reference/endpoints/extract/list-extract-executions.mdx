title: "List Extract Executions"
api: "GET https://api.getcatalog.ai/v2/extract"
description: "Retrieve a list of recent extraction executions"
---

Retrieve a list of recent extraction executions for your organization. This endpoint allows you to see all extraction jobs you've started (both direct URLs and vendor-based), their current status, and when they were created.

<Tip>
**When to use:** Monitor all your extraction operations in one place. Use this endpoint to:
- See all extraction executions you've started (both direct URLs and vendor-based modes)
- Filter by status (processing, completed, failed)
- Track when extraction jobs were initiated
- Find execution IDs for status checks
</Tip>

<Note>
**Unified Listing:** This endpoint returns executions from both extraction modes:
- **Direct URLs mode:** Execution IDs formatted as `extract-urls-{uuid}`
- **Vendor-based mode:** Execution IDs formatted as `extract-{vendor}-{uuid}`

Both types of executions appear in the same list and can be filtered and managed together.
</Note>

## Request

<ParamField header="x-api-key" type="string" required>
  Your API key for authentication
</ParamField>

### Query Parameters

<ParamField query="status" type="string" optional>
  Filter executions by status. Possible values: `"processing"`, `"completed"`, `"failed"`
  
  **Note:** If not provided, all executions are returned regardless of status.
  
  **Status Values:**
  - `"processing"` - Executions that are currently running or waiting to start (includes `pending` and `running` states)
  - `"completed"` - Executions that finished successfully
  - `"failed"` - Executions that failed or were aborted
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="page_size" type="number" optional>
  Number of executions to return (minimum: 1, maximum: 100, default: 20)
  
  **Note:** Executions are returned in reverse chronological order (most recent first).
</ParamField>
