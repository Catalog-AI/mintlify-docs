title: "Cancel Extract"
api: "DELETE https://api.getcatalog.ai/v2/extract/{execution_id}"
description: "Cancel a running extract. Stops an active extract job that is currently processing."
openapi: "openapi/v2-extract.yaml DELETE /extract/{execution_id}"
---

<Tip>
**When to use:** Use this endpoint when you need to stop an extraction job that is currently running. This is useful if:
- You started an extraction job by mistake
- The extraction is taking longer than expected and you want to stop it
- You need to free up resources for other operations
</Tip>

<Note>
**Cancellation Requirements:** You can only cancel executions that are currently running (status `"running"`). 
- If an execution has already completed or failed, it cannot be canceled
- Executions that are waiting for a crawl to complete (status `"pending"` with `waiting_for` in meta) cannot be canceled until they start running
- The endpoint will return an error if you attempt to cancel a non-running execution
</Note>
