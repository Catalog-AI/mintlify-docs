description: "Cancel a running extraction execution"
---

Cancel a running extraction execution. This endpoint stops an active extraction job that is currently processing.

<Tip>
**When to use:** Use this endpoint when you need to stop an extraction job that is currently running. This is useful if:
- You started an extraction job by mistake
- The extraction is taking longer than expected and you want to stop it
- You need to free up resources for other operations
</Tip>

<Note>
**Cancellation Requirements:** You can only cancel executions that are currently running (status `"running"`). 
- If an execution has already completed or failed, it cannot be canceled
- Executions that are waiting for a crawl to complete (status `"pending"` with `waiting_for` in meta) cannot be canceled until they start running
- The endpoint will return an error if you attempt to cancel a non-running execution

**Supported Execution Types:** This endpoint works for all extraction jobs:
- When using `urls`: Execution IDs formatted as `extract-urls-{uuid}`
- When using `vendor`: Execution IDs formatted as `extract-{vendor}-{uuid}` (e.g., `extract-nike-com-51d87084`)
</Note>

## Request

<ParamField header="x-api-key" type="string" required>
  Your API key for authentication
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="execution_id" type="string" required>
  The execution ID of the extraction job to cancel
  
  **Formats:**
  - `extract-urls-{uuid}` - When using `urls` (e.g., `extract-urls-965b1912-6af0-4ed8-b7e3-184b85e788b7`)
  - `extract-{vendor}-{uuid}` - When using `vendor` (e.g., `extract-nike-com-51d87084`)
  
  **Note:** If the execution ID does not exist or doesn't belong to your organization, the endpoint returns a 404 Not Found error.
</ParamField>

### Query Parameters

<ParamField query="arn" type="string" optional>
  Full AWS Step Functions execution ARN (optional override, used for advanced scenarios)
</ParamField>

## Response

  Status after cancellation. Always `"canceled"` on success.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="execution_id" type="string">

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="stop_date" type="string | null">
  ISO 8601 timestamp when the execution was stopped (null if not available)
</ResponseField>
