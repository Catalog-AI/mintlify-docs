title: "Cancel Crawl"
api: "DELETE https://api.getcatalog.ai/v1/crawl/{execution_id}"
description: "Cancel a running crawl. Stops an active crawl job that is currently processing."
---

<Tip>
**When to use:** Use this endpoint when you need to stop a crawl that is currently running. This is useful if:
- You started a crawl by mistake
- The crawl is taking longer than expected and you want to stop it
- You need to free up resources for other operations
</Tip>

<Note>
**Cancellation Requirements:** You can only cancel executions that are currently running. If an execution has already completed or failed, it cannot be canceled. The endpoint will return an error if you attempt to cancel a non-running execution.
</Note>
