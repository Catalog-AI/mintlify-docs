description: "How Catalog rate limiting works and what to expect in responses"
---

The Catalog platform uses a global, IP-scoped rate limit to keep traffic fair and reliable without slowing typical usage.

## Default policy

- 50 requests per 4-second sliding window.
- Counted per IP. If an IP cannot be determined, requests fall back to a shared global bucket.
- Applies to all public routes, including `/api/*` and `/v1/*`. Admin pages stay protected separately.

## Identification and scope

- We use standard IP headers where available (`x-forwarded-for`, `x-real-ip`, `cf-connecting-ip`).

## Headers and responses

- Successful requests include: `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, and `X-RateLimit-Reset` (ISO timestamp).
- Exceeded requests return `429 Too Many Requests` with a brief JSON error, plus the headers above and `Retry-After` (seconds). Content-Type is `application/json`.
