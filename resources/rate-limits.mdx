---

The Catalog platform uses a global, IP-scoped rate limit to keep traffic fair and reliable without slowing typical usage.

## Default policy

- 50 requests per 4-second sliding window.
- Counted per IP. If an IP cannot be determined, requests fall back to a shared global bucket.
- Applies to all public routes, including `/api/*` and `/v1/*`. Admin pages stay protected separately.

## Identification and scope

- We use standard IP headers where available (`x-forwarded-for`, `x-real-ip`, `cf-connecting-ip`).
- Internal workflow traffic (e.g., Upstash/QStash) is excluded so customer traffic is prioritized.

## Headers and responses

- Successful requests include: `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, and `X-RateLimit-Reset` (ISO timestamp).
- Exceeded requests return `429 Too Many Requests` with a brief JSON error, plus the headers above and `Retry-After` (seconds). Content-Type is `application/json`.

## Enabling and behavior

- If rate limiting is unavailable, requests are allowed to proceed (fail-open) to avoid blocking your traffic.

## Admin access

- `/admin` is protected by a password gate; rate-limit headers may still be present but do not affect access.

## Failure tolerance

- If the limiter cannot run, we do not block requests. Logging may occur for operational visibility.

## Best practices

- Monitor `X-RateLimit-Remaining` to pace requests.
- Back off and retry after the `Retry-After` duration when you see 429 responses.
- Batch requests when possible (for example, use bulk endpoints) to reduce call volume.
